there are 3 options when a user sends data to the server.
 1. send it to everyone using the server(group chat).
 2. send it to a specific person(personal chat).
 3. send it to everyone except sender.(Broadcasting). e.g: "typing..."


Why use npm init?
npm init: Starts the process of creating a package.json file (which stores metadata about your project like name, version, dependencies, etc.).


forEach loop can't break but for loop can.

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];

numbers.forEach((num) => {
  if (num === 3) return; // Skips only this iteration
  console.log(num);
});
// Output: 1, 2, 4 (cannot break fully)

Event listeners are used to respond to user actions

document.querySelector("button").addEventListener("click", () => {
  alert("Button clicked!");
});
